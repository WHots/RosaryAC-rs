## About The Project


RosaryAC is a **proof of concept (PoC)** user-sided anti-cheat client designed to safeguard game processes. This project is currently experimental and under development. The codebase and the project's direction are subject to change at any time.

**Project Change Log**
- **Date:** 8/6/2024
- **Update:** The project has transitioned to an EDR client.
  
- **Date:** 5/13/2024
- **Update:** The project has transitioned to an anti-cheat client.

This application is intended as a PoC for those interested in anti-cheat mechanisms. It is important to note that RosaryAC **does not provide resources for reversing cheats** or any malicious methods of gaining undetected access to game client processes. Additionally, it is not designed to target or single out any specific cheat provider.

### Built With

- **Rust Language:** The core of RosaryAC is built using Rust, known for its safety and performance.

### Prerequisites

To work with RosaryAC, you must have Rust and Cargo installed on your system. You can install them using rustup, which is available [here](https://rustup.rs/).

## Anti-Cheat Rules

To maintain fairness and integrity in gameplay, RosaryAC operates under the following rules:

1. **Proof of Malicious Process:**
   - The client **MUST** be able to prove that a malicious process is **running**. Merely having cheat software installed does **NOT** count. It must be proven that the cheat is running at the same time as the game.
   - It also **MUST** be proven that the malicious process is or had interaction with the protected game process.

2. **Memory and Process Interaction:**
   - The client **is NOT** allowed to write into process memory nor interact with system processes during the user-mode stages of this project. This ensures the client operates safely and respects system integrity.

3. **Querying Machine Information:**
   - The client **CAN** query machine information, but **ONLY** during runtime. None of the information queried should be personally identifiable to the user, maintaining user privacy and security.

4. **Network Connections:**
   - The client **is NOT** permitted to create any type of third-party network connection whatsoever. It must not download or upload files, nor fetch any information. The client is designed to operate **100% offline**.
